Our main goal is to create an app that improves the experience of living with others. We want to do that by making communication easier and more efficient. We have many ideas for features to implement for this app including lists, schedules, reminders and a bulletin board. The lists will be dynamic lists that allow roommates to create shopping lists, to-do lists, reminders and anything else they may want. We also want to create a scheduling system that shows when roommates will be at the apartment or not. We will have three types of users: the owner, roommates, and the viewer. The owner is the one who creates the "room" for the roommates to join. The roommates are the people living with the others in the "room". The viewer is for people who don't live there but visit often and may benefit from the information posted. We are going to accomplish this using JAVA in Android/Springboot and MySql.
